Phase Shift Gate

Denoted as ( R(\phi) ), is a single-qubit gate that adds a specific phase shift ( \phi ) to the state of a qubit.

It leaves the state |0⟩ unchanged: ( R(\phi) |0⟩ = |0⟩ ).
It changes the state |1⟩ by adding a phase: ( R(\phi) |1⟩ = e^{i\phi} |1⟩ ), where ( e^{i\phi} ) is a complex number representing the phase shift.

Matrix Representation: The Phase Shift Gate is represented by the following matrix:
[
R(\phi) = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \
0 & e^{i\phi}
\end{pmatrix}
]


Run the Following using python:
 
pip:
pip install qiskit
 
python:

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
import numpy as np

# Create a quantum circuit with 1 qubit
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)

# Initialize the qubit to |1⟩ state
qc.initialize([0, 1], 0)  # |1⟩

# Apply Phase Shift Gate, phi = pi/2 (90 degrees)
phi = np.pi / 2  # Phase shift
qc.rz(phi, 0)  # Apply R(φ) gate

# Measure the qubit
qc.measure_all()

# Draw the circuit
print(qc.draw())

# Execute the circuit on the qasm simulator
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
shots = 1024
result = execute(qc, backend, shots=shots).result()

# Get the results and plot
counts = result.get_counts()
print("\nCounts:", counts)

# Plot the result
plot_histogram(counts)
