Hadamard Gate

The Hadamard gate (H) is a single-qubit  that creates superposition, allowing a qubit to be in multiple states at once.

Use the Hadamard gate to change the qubit from |0⟩ into a superposition state.
This means the qubit is now in a mix of |0⟩ and |1⟩, giving it equal chances of being either state when measured.


Run the Following using python:

Python:

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Create a quantum circuit with 1 qubit
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)

# Initialize the qubit to |0⟩
qc.initialize([1, 0], 0)  # State |0⟩

# Apply Hadamard gate
qc.h(0)  # Create superposition state

# Measure the qubit
qc.measure_all()

# Draw the circuit
print(qc.draw())

# Execute the circuit on the qasm simulator
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
shots = 1024
result = execute(qc, backend, shots=shots).result()

# Get the results and plot
counts = result.get_counts()
print("\nCounts:", counts)

# Plot the result
plot_histogram(counts)
