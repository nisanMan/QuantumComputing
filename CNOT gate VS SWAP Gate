<b>CNOT Gate</b>

operates on two qubits: a control qubit and a target qubit. The CNOT gate performs the following operation:

If the control qubit is in the state |1⟩, the target qubit is flipped (i.e., if it is |0⟩, it becomes |1⟩, and vice versa).
If the control qubit is in the state |0⟩, the target qubit remains unchanged.


Run the Following using python:

pip:
pip install qiskit

python:

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Create a quantum circuit with 2 qubits
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)

# Initialize the control qubit (qubit 0) to |1⟩ and target qubit (qubit 1) to |0⟩
qc.x(0)  # Apply X gate to qubit 0 to set it to |1⟩

# Apply CNOT gate (control qubit 0, target qubit 1)
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Add a measurement to see the final state
qc.measure_all()

# Draw the circuit
print(qc.draw())

# Execute the circuit on the qasm simulator
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
shots = 1024
result = execute(qc, backend, shots=shots).result()

# Get the results and plot
counts = result.get_counts()
print("\nCounts:", counts)

# Plot the results
plot_histogram(counts)




<b>SWAP Gate</b>

A SWAP gate is another fundamental gate in quantum computing. It allows the exchange of states between two qubits. When the SWAP gate is applied, the states of the two qubits are swapped. 

Run the Following using python:
pip:
pip install qiskit 


python:

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Create a quantum circuit with 2 qubits
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)

# Initialize the qubits
qc.x(0)  # Set qubit 0 to |1⟩

# Apply SWAP gate to swap the two qubits
qc.swap(0, 1)

# Add measurements to see the final states
qc.measure_all()

# Draw the circuit
print(qc.draw())

# Execute the circuit on the qasm simulator
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
shots = 1024
result = execute(qc, backend, shots=shots).result()

# Get the results and plot
counts = result.get_counts()
print("\nCounts:", counts)

# Plot the results
plot_histogram(counts)

CNOT Gate
What it Does: Flips the second qubit (target) if the first qubit (control) is 1.
Example: If the first qubit is 1 and the second is 0, after CNOT, the second will be 1.
Purpose: Often used to create connections between qubits or "entanglement."

SWAP Gate
What it Does: Simply swaps the states of the two qubits.
Example: If the first qubit is 0 and the second is 1, after SWAP, the first will be 1 and the second will be 0.
Purpose: Used to change the order of qubits or move their states around in a circuit.
In short, CNOT changes one qubit based on another, while SWAP just exchanges their positions.
